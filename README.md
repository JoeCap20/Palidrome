# Palidrome
For a class assignment I had to create a program that check if a word entered was a palidrome or not.
This had to hold the string that was entered as well as remove any unwanted special characters from the input.

Then once it checked for an special characters it created a new string and then will check the reverse against the new string.
It will then return True if it is a palidrome or false if it isn't one.
